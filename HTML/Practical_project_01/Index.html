                So today's topic mainly focused for introducing myself as this blog author. I am <abbr title="Baltic Instutute of technology">BIT</abbr> student, <br> 
                who is studying <i><b>full-stack </b></i>course started 14th of February 2022. How I am doing you will be able track in future as I post more blog articles. </p>

                     <p> Hello, my name is Dalius I am 29 years old and live in Druskininkai, Lithuania. I have been interested in compiuters since childhood,
                           for me it was gadget where I spend endless hours discovering new things, comunicating with others and playing various video games.<br>
                           First experience with coding I faced when I was 13 years old. <br>
                            In that time was in 7th grade of school. School's IT teacher at that time have been teaching us basic programming with "Pascal" language for me it was totally garbage. As for homework we got simple
                           tasks as draw arious shapes like triangles, squares, circles and had to fill up with color it was headache for me becouse we have
                           done that in home in assigment book and later on lesson time write out into compiuter to compile. I mostly had made simple 
                           syntax errors, luckly I had very smart classmate who sat next to me and point it out for me. <br>
                            Next year I had more pleasant experience. It was very simple experience and basically I can't call it as coding. However, I liked it I spend many night doing it. By that time one of most 
                            popular game was Grand theft auto: San Andreas and as completed it many times it get bored, so I started to play it online. <br> 
                            Afterwards I found some server files to download and host it as mine it was written in <i><b>pawn</b></i> language. So becouse 
                            I was newbe in coding,  mine task was simple very simple I just edit script file. Acctually only thing I did was changing lines from
                            english to Lithuanian and host it. That was one of few  hosted lithuanian servers, but no so long after hype went down and I 
                            abandoned that. <br> Later, I started play others online games, one of them - Runescape. So, I also find some servers for download
                            and did same thing. But auditory was humble so just only few people was playing. <br> Most people who know me thought my future belong
                             with programming, but I was the one who made wrong decision. So I decided choose other way, that made my future more uncertain...<br>
                              I started study the subject which totaly unsuits for my personality and goals...<br>
                               And now I am here and my new journey to IT starts from here. Thats all for this time. See ya soon.

        <h2>2022 February's review and remaining objectives. </h2>
        <p><b>Today I would like to share my plans for rest of February, also review last 2 weeks achievements.</b> </p><details> <summary><strong> Click here: </strong>To read whole story. </summary>
            <p>First of all, today ends 2nd week as I have started to study in <abbr title="Baltic Instutute of technology">BIT</abbr>. Well, this web blog 
                acctually is a result what I have learned so far. Well I can't say it was hard, as I put not too much efford in it. So what I have learnt so far?
                 well we finished out first phase of studies about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and acctually I have some knowleadge how to make websites. 
                Yesterday, we got our first project task to do. To make mini personal IT blog using what we have learnt. So my task for rest of this month (3-5days) to finish this
                 project. Of course propably I still update this web site time by time. However, now the main purpoise is fulfill task requiments by showing my <abbr title="Baltic Instutute of technology">BIT</abbr> skills. 
                For next few weeks I will be studying <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> acctualy, I have started it last week by my own, because HTML wasn't
                 so intense and hard subject to learn. Also as I have had some coding experience as I spent some time studying <b>C++ </b>before. Despite the fact it was back-end technology language. 
                 It gave me quite good understanding of fundamentally programming and front-end conceptions aswell.
